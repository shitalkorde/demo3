<h2>Babasaheb Dr.Bhimrao Ambedkar was born on 14th April, 1891 at Mhow, 
near Indore in the then Central Province, now Madhya Pradesh. 
<br>He was the fourteenth child of his parents. The life of Dr. 
Bhimrao Ambedkar was marked by struggles but he proved that every hurdle in life can
 be surmounted with talent and firm determination. 
 The biggest barrier in his life
 was the caste system according to which the family he was born in was considered '
 untouchable'.<br>In the year 1907, young Bhimrao passed the Matriculation examination
 from Bombay University with flying colours. 
 Later in 1913 he graduated in Political Science and
 Economics from Bombay University. Around the same time his father passed away. </h2>
<h3>Although he was going through a bad time,
 Bhimrao decided to accept the opportunity to go to USA for further studies at 
 Columbia University for which he was awarded a scholarship by the Maharaja of
 Baroda. </h3>
